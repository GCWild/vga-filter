# VGA-filter

Filter for use with the [Loot Filters](https://runelite.net/plugin-hub/show/loot-filters) plugin for Old School Runescape.

Categories and icons for drops according to value, material, origin or rarity.
Primarily for ironmen that never want to hide any drops - only regular bones are hidden.

Most boss drops and notable items have bespoke icons with appropriate colours added to them.
Some are deliberately left empty to avoid clutter.

# Installation

Just drag and drop the icons/ and filters/ folders into your .runelite/loot-filters/ folder.


## Optional sound functionality
The filter is configured to use .wav sounds. It expects these sounds to be named 'rar_0.wav'-'rar_5.wav'.
The intention is that the higher the number, the rarer the item that dropped.
I cannot include these sounds here, but you may freely substitute your own sounds to make use of this functionality
if you make a sounds/ folder in your loot-filters/ folder and add files with these names.

# Additional visuals

This resource pack works best when paired with my [resource pack](https://github.com/GCWild/pack-vgascape/tree/main), as the visuals for both were created in tandem.

Oh, and here's a quick cursor I made for the pack as well. You can use Runelites 'Custom Cursor' plugin for this one - it's the correct size.
