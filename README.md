# VGA-filter

Filter for use with the [Loot Filters](https://runelite.net/plugin-hub/show/loot-filters) plugin for Old School Runescape.

Categories and icons for drops according to value, material, origin or rarity.
Colors and backgrounds of the drops denominate value and rarity while icons provide quick context to the type of drop - potions, material etc..

Primarily for ironmen that never want to hide any drops - only regular bones are hidden.

### This is an ironman filter! If you don't want drops from other people to be de-prioritised, remove the section called 'ownership clause' at the bottom of the filter.

Most boss drops and notable items have bespoke icons with appropriate colours added to them.
Drops with nominal value have exceptions added to them to produce a satisfying rush when they drop.


# Installation

Just drag and drop the icons/ and filters/ folders into your .runelite/loot-filters/ folder.


## Optional sound functionality

The filter is configured to use .wav sounds. It expects these sounds to be named 'rar_0.wav'-'rar_5.wav'.
The intention is that the higher the number, the rarer the item that dropped.
I cannot include these sounds here, but you may freely substitute your own sounds to make use of this functionality
if you make a sounds/ folder in your .runelite/loot-filters/ folder and add files with these names.

# Additional visuals

This resource pack works best when paired with my [resource pack](https://github.com/GCWild/pack-vgascape/tree/main), as the visuals for both were created in tandem.

Oh, and here's a quick cursor I made for the pack as well. You can use Runelites 'Custom Cursor' plugin for this one - it's the correct size.
