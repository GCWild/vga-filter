# wobbly-filter

Filter for use with the [Loot Filters](https://runelite.net/plugin-hub/show/loot-filters) plugin for Old School Runescape.

Categories and icons for drops according to value, material, origin or rarity.
Primarily for ironmen that never want to hide any drops - only regular bones are hidden.

Most boss drops and notable items have bespoke icons with appropriate colours added to them.
Some are deliberately left empty to avoid clutter.

Modify to your liking!
Just don't redistribute the icons without attribution - gonekittywild.


# Installation

Just drag and drop the icons/ and filters/ folders into your .runelite/loot-filters/ folder.

The filter is configured to use .wav sounds. It expects these sounds to be named 'rar_0.wav'-'rar_5.wav'.
The intention is that the higher the number, the rarer the item that dropped.
I cannot include these sounds here, but you may freely substitute your own sounds to make use of this functionality
if you make a sounds/ folder in your loot-filters/ folder and add files with these names.
