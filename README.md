# wobbly-filter

Filter for use with the [Loot Filters](https://runelite.net/plugin-hub/show/loot-filters) plugin for Old School Runescape.

Categories and icons for drops according to value, material, origin or rarity.
Primarily for ironmen that never want to hide any drops - only regular bones are hidden.

Most boss drops and notable items have bespoke icons with appropriate colours added to them.
Some are deliberately left empty to avoid clutter.

Modify to your liking!
Just don't redistribute the icons without attribution - gonekittywild.

# Installation

Just drag and drop the icons/ and filters/ folders into your .runelite/loot-filters/ folder.
